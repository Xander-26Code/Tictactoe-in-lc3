4. #### The implementation 

- how to show the game board?
- How to let the user to choose the sides?
- how to store the information of every small square on the chessboard?

we use .BLKW to allocate blocks of memory to store the data("X","O")

- how to switch the player?

since there is no "==" or "if/else" in lc3, so we must use addition and branch to implement that

- how to update the data in small square?
- how to justify whether the game is over.
- how to know who win the game
- how to output the final winner?
